            "Answer: Let's think step by step. Python is a programming language that is designed to be easy to read and understand, even for people who are not experienced programmers. It is a general-purpose language, which means it can be used for many different tasks, such as creating websites, software, or automating tasks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Python is considered a \"high-level\" language because it abstracts away the complex details of the computer hardware, allowing programmers to focus on the actual logic and functionality of their programs.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the key features of Python is its use of indentation to structure the code. This makes the code more visually appealing and easier to read. Python is also dynamically typed, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than being declared ahead of time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, Python is garbage-collected, meaning that it automatically manages memory usage, freeing the programmer from having to manually allocate and deallocate memory.\n",
            "\n",
            "Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. This flexibility allows programmers to choose the approach that best fits their needs for a particular project.\n",

The series debuted with the video game StarCraft in 1998. It has grown to include a number of other games as well as eight novelizations, two Amazing Stories articles, a board game, and other licensed merchandise such as collectible statues and toys.\n",
            "Blizzard Entertainment began planning StarCraft in 1995 with a development team led by Metzen and Phinney. The game debuted at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo and used a modified Warcraft II game engine. StarCraft also marked the creation of Blizzard Entertainment's film department; the game introduced high quality cinematics integral to the storyline of the series. Most of the original development team for StarCraft returned to work on the game's expansion pack, Brood War; that game's development began only shortly after StarCraft was released. In 2001, StarCraft: Ghost began development under Nihilistic Software. Unlike the previous real-time strategy games in the series, Ghost was to be a stealth-action game. After three years of development, work on the game was postponed in 2004. Development of a true RTS sequel, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, began in 2003; the game was announced in May 2007 and was released in July 2010. StarCraft II continued with the StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm expansion, which was released in March 2013. The third and final StarCraft II installment, Legacy of the Void, was released in November 2015. In 2016, a single-player nine-mission pack, Nova Covert Ops, was released in form of DLC.The original game and its expansion have been praised as one of the benchmark real-time strategy games of its time. The series has gathered a solid following around the world, particularly in South Korea, where professional players and teams participate in matches, earn sponsorships, and compete in televised matches. By June 2007, StarCraft and Brood War had sold nearly 10 million copies combined. StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty and its sequels obtained similar praise, and also sold very well. By the end of 2017, the franchise's lifetime revenue totaled over $1 billion. In addition, the series was awarded a star on the Walk of Game in 2006, and holds four Guinness World Records in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition of 2008.On March 27, 2017, Blizzard announced StarCraft: Remastered, a remastered version of the original StarCraft, with the core updates being up-to-date graphics and revised dialogue and audio. As of 2017, the original StarCraft, its Brood War expansion, and StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty are free to download and play from Blizzard's website.\n",
